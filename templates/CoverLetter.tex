  \opening{Dear Human Resources:}
I wish to express my interest for the Software Developer position at the IMA Lab.  After meeting Gray Bowman at the monthly Python Meetup, I became aware of the IMA Lab, their projects, and about their mission of embracing open source philosophies to better the cultural sector as a whole, something that I am personally very passionate about.  Although I do not have a formal CS degree, I am confident that I have the skills required for the position and with my investment in open source principles and my strong interest in the arts I believe our similar cultures and philosophies will allow me to get up to speed quickly.

I have been a proponent of Linux and FOSS for the last decade and have given back to the community by attending Meetups, assisting in IRC and forums, and contributing where I could (documentation, user stories, etc).  Two years ago I decided to seriously learn development so that I could contribute code and I chose Python for my first language.  I continue to use Python today because of its power, readability, and simplicity, making it possible to go from a prototype to full-fledged application quickly while maintaining beautiful, well-documented code.

On my resume you will notice a recent employment gap and I would be more than happy to discuss this further in person.  Briefly, after a series of family events, I found myself moving back to my home state to be closer to them.  Noticing a lack of demand for someone with 10 years of experience in Motion Picture Production, I decided to make another one of my passions into a career.

I keep up-to-date of all the happenings in the tech world and I am constantly learning new skills and crafts, e.g.\, I recently purchased a couple microcontrollers and have learned to quick pickle vegetables.  Living in several different cities and traveling has allowed me to explore my passion for cinema and photography.  Since arriving in Indianapolis I regularly visit the Garfield Park Arts Center and the Indianapolis Repertory Theatre.  While living in Chicago I spent many afternoons at the Art Institute and the MCA. Living in L.A.\@ gave me the opportunity to see a fantastic talk by Errol Morris and Ricky Jay at the Getty, see the Philip Glass Orchestra perform Powaqqatsi. Last year I also had the privilege of attending the Documenta 13 art festival in Kassel, Germany.

I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to the IMA Lab and the cultural technology community.
